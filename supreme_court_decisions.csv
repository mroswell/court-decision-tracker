The court concluded that Medley stated promissory estoppel and negligent misrepresentation claims against the District but did not state a due process claim against the District or any claim against LEDC. The court granted the District's motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part, and granted LEDC's motion to dismiss.","The decision centers on contract law principles (promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation) and does not clearly align with either liberal or conservative ideologies on larger constitutional questions.",15000,2026-01-23

Scholle was acquitted of criminal charges, and Cotton sued Scholle for damages. Scholle counterclaimed, seeking damages for his criminal defense costs under the ""wrong-of-another"" doctrine, arguing Cotton's trespass led to his prosecution. The court affirmed the trial court's decision that Scholle couldn't recover these costs because the criminal charges weren't a foreseeable consequence of Cotton's trespass.",The decision focuses on applying established legal principles (proximate cause and the wrong-of-another doctrine) to the specific facts of the case. There's no clear ideological leaning in the legal analysis.,15000,2026-01-23

The administrative law judge (ALJ) used a method the appellate court found inappropriate for her specific employment situation. The Court of Appeals set aside the decision and remanded the case, instructing the ALJ to recalculate Hargon's AWW using the discretionary exception provided in the law, which allows for a fairer calculation when the default methods are inadequate.","The decision focuses on the correct application of administrative procedures within the context of employment law, specifically regarding the calculation of worker's compensation benefits. The court doesn't exhibit a clear leaning toward either liberal or conservative ideologies; rather, it emphasizes adherence to the proper legal process.",10401,2026-01-23

The Court of Appeals dismissed the father's appeal of the APR order as untimely, finding that the finality rule established in *In re Marriage of Hill* (regarding attorney fees requests delaying finality in dissolution cases) does not apply to APR proceedings unrelated to divorce. The court reasoned that APR cases focus primarily on the child's best interests, while divorce proceedings involve the intertwined issues of asset division, maintenance, and attorney fees. However, the court reversed the award of attorney fees and remanded the case for further proceedings due to unsupported findings.","The decision is procedural, concerning the timeliness of an appeal, and the court clarifies the applicability of a prior ruling on finality, not creating any new legal precedents that could be considered leaning.",15000,2026-01-23

The court addressed Kevin's appeal, which contended that the property distribution was inequitable, particularly concerning the marital residence's appreciation and the diminished 401(k).

The court affirmed the lower court's decision, finding that the magistrate's decision was supported by the record, including the father's limited involvement in the child's life, a positive drug test, and no evidence that the child was endangered in the mother's care. The court also addressed the father's procedural objections regarding the hearing transcript and admission of drug test results, finding that he failed to properly preserve those issues for appeal.",This case deals with a very specific family law matter within the bounds of established state law.

The husband, Darryl, appealed the maintenance order, arguing that the district court's findings regarding his income were insufficient and that the court failed to properly analyze relevant factors. The Court of Appeals upheld the district court's ruling, finding no abuse of discretion in imputing income to the husband based on a negative inference drawn from his failure to disclose financial information and concluding that the court sufficiently considered the statutory factors relevant to maintenance awards.","The decision focuses on applying existing state law regarding divorce and spousal maintenance, with no discernible ideological leaning in the court's legal analysis, thus classifying it as center.",15000,2026-01-23

The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the Panel's decision, finding that Nicholson's appeal was filed more than 180 days after the deadline and that the Panel's finding that she received notice of the determination was supported by substantial evidence. The court held that the mailing date of the notice, not the date of receipt, triggers the appeal timeframe and that Nicholson was responsible for keeping the Division informed of her address.","The decision is a straightforward application of administrative regulations and procedural rules, without revealing any particular ideological leaning.

The father appealed the termination, arguing that the Arapahoe County Department of Human Services did not exercise due diligence in determining if the child was an Indian child under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), and that the juvenile court erred in finding him unfit and unlikely to become fit. The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the juvenile court's decision, finding that the Department had exercised due diligence under ICWA, and that the evidence supported the finding that the father was unfit and unlikely to become fit within a reasonable time.","The decision hinges on applying existing statutes and legal precedents to the specific facts of the case, primarily regarding the application of the ICWA and the determination of parental fitness; this doesn't indicate a leaning toward either end of the spectrum.",15000,2026-01-23
