Scholle counterclaimed for trespass and sought to recover his criminal defense costs under the ""wrong-of-another"" doctrine, arguing that Cotton's actions caused his criminal prosecution. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that Scholle's criminal defense expenses were not a foreseeable consequence of Cotton's trespass, but rather a result of Scholle's own actions.","The court's decision focuses on applying established legal principles (proximate cause and the ""wrong-of-another"" doctrine) to the specific facts of the case without showing any obvious leaning towards one side of the political spectrum.",15000,2026-01-23

The administrative law judge (ALJ) applied the default provision of Colorado's workers' compensation law to calculate her AWW, but the Court of Appeals found that the ALJ misapplied the law because Hargon's remuneration was based on an hourly basis during short-term contracts, not production output. The Court set aside the order and remanded the case, instructing the ALJ to determine Hargon’s AWW under the discretionary exception.","The decision focuses on proper application of existing administrative and employment law, clarifying the circumstances under which specific sections of the state’s workers' compensation laws apply. This clarification doesn't inherently favor a liberal or conservative stance, placing it in the center.",10401,2026-01-23

The court decided that such orders are final and appealable, distinguishing them from dissolution of marriage cases. The court found the father's appeal of the parental responsibility order was untimely, but reversed the attorney fee award due to unsupported findings, remanding the case for further proceedings on the fees issue.","The decision focuses on procedural rules (timeliness of appeal) and distinguishes the case from prior precedent based on the specific context of parental responsibility cases versus dissolution of marriage, showing a neutral application of law.",15000,2026-01-23

The Court of Appeals found no abuse of discretion, holding that the district court appropriately considered evidence of the parties' current and prospective retirement income and that its factual findings were supported by the record.","The decision focuses on applying established legal principles of family law and property distribution within the specific factual context, without demonstrating a clear ideological leaning.",15000,2026-01-23

The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's decision, finding that the district court acted within its discretion to impute income to Darryl based on his failure to disclose financial information and that the court adequately considered the statutory factors in awarding maintenance.","The decision is a fairly standard application of existing family law statutes and procedures, and it doesn't indicate a strong ideological leaning in either direction.",15000,2026-01-23

The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the Panel's order, finding that substantial evidence supported the Panel’s finding that the Division mailed the notice and appeal information on May 31, 2024, thus triggering the appeal timeframe, and that Nicholson bore responsibility for informing the Division of an address where she could receive mail. The court also held that a Division employee's failure to notify Nicholson of the appeal timeframe and Nicholson’s unfamiliarity with the Division’s MyUI+ electronic platform did not merit setting aside the Panel’s order.","The court applies existing regulations and defers to the factual findings of the administrative panel, without showing a bias to either side.",9556,2026-01-23

The father appealed, arguing that the Department of Human Services didn't properly assess whether the child was an Indian child under ICWA, and that the court erred in finding him unfit. The court affirmed the termination, finding that the Department exercised due diligence regarding ICWA and that clear and convincing evidence supported the determination that the father was unfit and unlikely to become fit within a reasonable time, primarily due to his inability to protect the child from the child's mother's substance abuse.","The decision is primarily focused on applying existing law regarding parental fitness and ICWA due diligence, without expanding or restricting rights in a way that clearly aligns with either liberal or conservative legal principles.",15000,2026-01-23

The court held that the People presented sufficient evidence to prove that the four elements required for involuntary medication under People v. Medina were met, specifically addressing and rejecting Depatie's arguments that a less intrusive treatment alternative existed and that his need for medication did not outweigh his legitimate interest in refusing it.","The decision relies on established precedent (People v. Medina) and applies a deferential standard of review to the lower court's factual findings. There is no expansion of rights or imposition of new restrictions, reflecting a neutral application of existing law.",11335,2026-01-23
