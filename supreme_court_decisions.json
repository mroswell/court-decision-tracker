    "summary": "The Supreme Court vacated the Eleventh Circuit's judgment regarding Joseph Clifton Smith's death sentence, which had been vacated by the District Court due to Smith's possible intellectual disability. The central issue was how to interpret multiple IQ scores, particularly in light of the standard error of measurement. The Supreme Court found the Eleventh Circuit's reasoning unclear, uncertain whether they applied a per se rule or a more holistic approach, and remanded the case for clarification.",
    "reasoning": "The court did not make any decisions that would be considered conservative or liberal. It simply vacated and remanded because the lower court's reasoning was unclear.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court in Bouarfa v. Mayorkas addressed whether the Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to revoke an approved visa petition based on a sham-marriage determination is a discretionary decision that is shielded from judicial review by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). The Court unanimously held that such revocations are discretionary and therefore not subject to judicial review, emphasizing that § 1155 grants broad authority to the Secretary to revoke visa petitions \"at any time\" for \"good and sufficient cause.\"",
    "reasoning": "The decision hinges on statutory interpretation and the allocation of power between the executive and judicial branches in immigration matters, lacking a discernible ideological bent and therefore, fits into the \"Center\" category.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court addressed the standard of proof required for employers to demonstrate that an employee is exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act's (FLSA) minimum wage and overtime pay provisions.

    "summary": "The Supreme Court addressed the issue of supplemental jurisdiction in cases removed to federal court. It held that when a plaintiff amends their complaint after removal to eliminate all federal-law claims, leaving only state-law claims, the federal court loses supplemental jurisdiction over the state claims and must remand the case back to state court. The Court reasoned that the statutory text of 28 U.S.C. § 1367 and procedural rules link jurisdiction to the amended complaint.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court upheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which effectively bans TikTok in the United States unless ByteDance Ltd. divests its control. The Court found that the Act does not violate the First Amendment rights of TikTok or its users, as it survives intermediate scrutiny because it furthers an important government interest in national security (preventing China from accessing user data) and is sufficiently tailored to address that interest.",

Tennessee did not establish this principle as a holding, and therefore instructed the Tenth Circuit to reconsider whether the Oklahoma court unreasonably applied this principle.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court addressed whether alleging the commingling of funds alone satisfies the commercial nexus requirement of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act's (FSIA) expropriation exception. The Court held that it does not, requiring plaintiffs to trace either the specific expropriated property or property exchanged for it to the United States. The Court emphasized the need for a plausible connection between the specific proceeds from the expropriated property and commercial activity in the United States, rejecting the idea that simply commingling funds is sufficient. This interpretation aligns with the FSIA's structure, history, and purpose of providing limited exceptions to sovereign immunity.",
    "reasoning": "The decision favors a narrower interpretation of the FSIA's expropriation exception, which protects foreign states from suits in US courts, indicating a leaning towards a conservative approach that respects national sovereignty and limits judicial intervention in international affairs.",

The Court held that they do not qualify, because the preliminary injunction did not conclusively resolve their claims or create an enduring change in the legal relationship between the parties.

    "notes": "[Business/Commerce - The case involves a dispute between an employer and employee related to arbitration;Administrative Law - The case revolves around interpreting Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court addressed whether a voluntary dismissal without prejudice under Rule 41(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure qualifies as a \"final judgment, order, or proceeding\" under Rule 60(b). The Court held that it does, allowing a district court to reopen a case voluntarily dismissed without prejudice under Rule 41(a) for reasons stated in Rule 60(b). The Court reasoned that the text, context, and history of Rule 60(b) support the conclusion that a Rule 41(a) voluntary dismissal without prejudice qualifies as a “final proceeding.”",
    "reasoning": "The ruling is primarily procedural, interpreting the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and does not inherently favor a particular political ideology, thus placing it in the \"Center\".",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court case of City and County of San Francisco v. EPA addressed whether the EPA could include \"end-result\" provisions in NPDES permits under the Clean Water Act, provisions that hold permittees liable if water quality standards are not met, regardless of their compliance with specific permit terms. The Court held that the EPA lacked the authority to impose these \"end-result\" requirements, finding that the CWA requires the EPA to set specific rules for permittees to follow to achieve water quality goals, and this decision was supported by the Act's text, structure, and history.",
    "reasoning": "The Court's decision to limit the EPA's regulatory power under the Clean Water Act, favoring a more defined set of requirements over broad, outcome-based standards, aligns with a conservative judicial philosophy that typically favors limiting federal agency power and respecting state regulatory roles.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court addressed the standard of review the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims must apply when reviewing the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) application of the \"benefit-of-the-doubt rule\" in disability claims. The Court held that the Veterans Court must review the VA's application of the rule in the same way it would any other determination, by reviewing legal issues de novo and factual issues for clear error. The Court also determined that the VA's determination that the evidence is in approximate balance is a predominantly factual determination, reviewed only for clear error.",
    "reasoning": "The decision focuses on interpreting existing statutes regarding veterans' benefits and judicial review, rather than establishing any new legal principles that strongly align with either conservative or liberal ideologies. The court is deferring to the VA in factual determinations.",

This broadens the scope of what qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under the statute.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court in *Thompson v. United States* considered whether 18 U.S.C. § 1014, prohibiting \"knowingly mak[ing] any false statement\" to influence the FDIC, also criminalizes misleading statements. The Court held that the statute only criminalizes *false* statements, not merely *misleading* ones, relying on the plain text of the statute, the context of other statutes that explicitly prohibit both \"false\" and \"misleading\" statements, and prior precedent. The Court vacated the Seventh Circuit's decision and remanded the case to determine whether Thompson's statements were demonstrably *false*.",
    "reasoning": "The decision is a straightforward textualist interpretation of a statute, focusing on the plain meaning of the word \"false\" and distinguishing it from \"misleading\". This approach doesn't inherently favor either a liberal or conservative outcome, making it a center classification.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court in Bondi v. Vanderstok reversed the Fifth Circuit's ruling, holding that the ATF's rule interpreting the Gun Control Act (GCA) to cover weapon parts kits and partially complete frames or receivers is not facially inconsistent with the GCA. The Court reasoned that the statute's definition of \"firearm\" could reasonably be interpreted to include certain weapon parts kits and partially complete frames/receivers, especially those readily convertible into functional firearms.",
    "reasoning": "The ruling favors a broader interpretation of gun regulations, but within the framework of existing statutes, and upholds federal regulatory power, aligning with a conservative approach to judicial restraint, while siding on the side of gun regulations.",
